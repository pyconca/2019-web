Our business revolves around the connections made between the consumers who read and write reviews and the local businesses that they patronize. Since Yelp was founded in San Francisco back in July 2004, we have taken root across 32 countries. Our engineering culture is driven by our values: we’re a cooperative team that values individual authenticity, and encourages “unboring” solutions to problems. New hires are expected to deploy working code their first week, and your impact will only grow from there with the support of your manager, mentor and team. At the end of the day, we are all about helping our users, growing as engineers, and having fun in a collaborative environment."
