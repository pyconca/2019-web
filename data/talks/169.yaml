talk_abstract: "For a Python developer, using PySpark can often feel foreign, like driving a race car in sandals. You see the power, yet it feels like you're fighting against the machine.

This talk is about battle stories using PySpark from development to production, and how my many errors can lead to better code on your end. In no particular order, I'll discuss about speeding up your development, avoiding 'friendly enemies' and testing your code. You'll see how to avoid embarrassing mistakes by seeing me making them, and you'll leave a more insightful PySpark developer."
